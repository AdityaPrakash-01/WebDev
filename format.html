                The story Begins here
            </h2>
            <p>
                Once upon a time there lived an old goat who had <b>seven young</b> ones whom she loved as every mother loves her children. One day she wanted to go into the forest to fetch some food so calling her seven young ones together, she said, “Dear children, I am going away into the forest. Be careful about the wolf. If he comes here he will eat you all up. He often disguises himself. But you can make him out by his rough voice and his black feet." The little goats replied, "Dear mother, we will be very careful and obey your words. You may go away without any fear." So the mother goat left her dear children and went into the forest. The little goats locked their house carefully from inside and shut the windows tightly.

            <p>
                Not long after-wards, <s> knocked</s> banged <strong>at the door and called out</strong>, "Open, my dear children. I am your mother and I got something for each one of you." But the little goats found from the rough voice that it was a wolf and so they said. "We will not open the door. You are not our mother. She has a gentle and loving voice. But yours is gruff. You are a wolf."

            </p>
            <h2>
                This is the next part
            </h2>
            <p>
                So the wolf went away and <br><i>he ate some chalk and by that means</i><br> rendered his voice more gentle. Then he came back, knocked at the door and said. "Open, my dear children. Your mother has come home." But the wolf had placed his black paws near the opening of the door, so the little goats saw them and replied, “No, we will not open the door. Our mother has no black feet. You are a wolf."

                So the wolf went away and dipped his black foot in white chalk powder and turned them white in colour. Now the bad wolf went to the house for the third time and knocked at the door and said, "Open up! My young ones. Your dear mother has come and has brought with her something for each one of you out of the forest." The little goats replied, "Show us first your feet to see whether you are our mother." So the bad wolf put his feet up near the opening of the door and when the little goats saw that they were white, they thought it was all right and unlocked the door. But alas! The wolf had entered the house this time.
